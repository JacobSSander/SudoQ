# SudoQ

Nice Sudoku App, I want to experiment on, improve it.

## Why does this fork exist?

I forked the fork to experiment with Open-Source contributing and chose the full Java version because I don't know Kotlin.

### Planed Changes

- Mark/Disable the number buttons for numbers that are solved.
- Maybe change how notes are handled. Remove the need for double tapping each cell to make a note.
